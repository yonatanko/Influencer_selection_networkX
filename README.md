This project involves a data-driven analysis of the impact of influencers on e-commerce sales in a simulated social network environment. Using datasets from a fictional online store 'Instaglam' and a music streaming app 'Spotifly,' the task is to select influencers for artist-branded merchandise and analyze their influence on purchase probabilities in their social networks. The project combines network analysis with the NetworkX library, probability calculations, and Python programming to understand the dynamics of social influence in online retail. The repository contains data files, a detailed methodology in PDF format, and the Python code used for the analysis.
